        We're having our wedding at the lovely <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thelookoutinn.com">Lookout Inn</a> in Brooklin, Maine. The house dates back to the 1700s and has incredible views of the water. Several cottages are sprinkled throughout the grounds. Beyond the meadow is the beach, and a few of the rocky islands can be explored when the tide is low. We'll have the whole place to ourselves for the whole weekend, which will hosted by Butch and Marsha. Since the Lookout has limited room, some people will stay in another hotel in town or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.airbnb.com/s/Brooklin--ME--United-States/homes?children=0&infants=0&query=Brooklin%2C%20ME%2C%20United%20States&place_id=ChIJYdbHeQKbrkwRQuftsyD7xP0&checkin=2019-09-27&checkout=2019-09-30&toddlers=0&adults=2&guests=2&refinement_paths%5B%5D=%2Fhomes&allow_override%5B%5D=&s_tag=H6-cptyf">Airbnbs</a> / <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vrbo.com/results?adultsCount=2&petIncluded=false&q=brooklin%2C%20me&from-date=2019-09-27&to-date=2019-09-30">VRBOs</a>.
